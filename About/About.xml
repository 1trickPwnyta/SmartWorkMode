Mechs in Work mode waste a lot of energy wandering around idly when there is no work for them to do. This mod adds a new work mode for mechs called Smart Work. Smart Work functions the same as Work but with the following differences:
- There is no patrol activity for combat mechs.
- When idle, mechs go into self-shutdown (similar to Self Shutdown mode) to recharge slowly, but will wake back up when more work becomes available.
- You can set an area (per control group) for idle self-shutdown in the Mechs tab. Mechs will move to that area before shutting down to charge.
