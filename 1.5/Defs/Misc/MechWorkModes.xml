    <description>Work autonomously according to mechanoid type. Automatically go to rechargers and recharge when needed. When idle, go into a dormant self-charging state that very slowly regains energy without a recharger. For game balance, self-charging only works when the mechanitor has another control group set to dormant self-charge.</description>
